For your church website, the **Vercel Hobby plan** is likely the most suitable and cost-effective option, especially for starting out.

Here's a breakdown of why:

### Vercel Hobby Plan (Recommended)

*   **Cost-Effective**: It's completely free for personal and non-commercial projects, which a church website typically falls under.
*   **Generous Usage Limits**: The Hobby plan offers ample bandwidth, serverless function execution time, and build minutes. For a standard informational website with dynamic content like event listings, sermon archives, and an admin panel, these limits are generally more than sufficient.
*   **Core Features Included**:
    *   **Automatic Git Deployment**: Seamless integration with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Every push to your `main` branch (or configured production branch) automatically triggers a new deployment.
    *   **Custom Domains**: You can connect your own custom domain (e.g., `www.yourchurch.com`) to your project even on the Hobby plan.
    *   **Global Edge Network (CDN)**: Your website will be fast and performant for visitors worldwide, as Vercel distributes your content globally.
    *   **HTTPS/SSL**: Vercel automatically provides free SSL certificates for your custom domains, ensuring your site is secure.

### Vercel Pro Plan

The Pro plan is designed for professional teams, commercial applications, or projects with very high traffic and advanced requirements. You would typically consider a Pro plan if:

*   You anticipate extremely high traffic (millions of concurrent users or very high data transfer).
*   You need advanced team features, more granular permissions, and dedicated support.
*   Your project involves complex, resource-intensive serverless functions that exceed Hobby plan limits.
*   You require detailed analytics, uptime monitoring, and logging beyond what the Hobby plan provides.

### Conclusion

Given that your primary goal is to make the website available for your church members and the wider world as a functional resource, the **Vercel Hobby plan provides an excellent foundation**. It's free, powerful, and specifically optimized for Next.js applications, making it ideal for your needs. You can always monitor your usage and consider upgrading if your website's needs grow significantly in the future.
